The following options still need to be implemented

- pk Allows using a different autoincrement primary key other than id. It might also be convenient to allow specification on table by table basis
- Automatically detect many to many tables that don't have an autoincrement primary key
- Option to exclude some tables
- Option to only reverse engineer some tables
